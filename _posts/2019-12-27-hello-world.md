# Printing Hello World!

Let's start with a fun and popular introductory programming example:  printing Hello world! to the console.  To do so in Kotlin, we use the `println()` function.  It takes any text in quotes and prints it to the console. 

`println("Hello world!")`

For reasons that will be explained in a future lesson, we need to write this programming statement inside of a main function:

```
fun main() {
	println("Hello world!")
}
```

Add that bit of code in an empty .kt file, then compile and run!  You should see 'Hello world!' displayed on the console.
