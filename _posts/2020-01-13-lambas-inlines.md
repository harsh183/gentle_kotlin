## Lambda Functions

### What are Lambda Functions?

Lambdas are an interesting way to write and declare functions; we've seen them written formally up to this point, involving the `fun` keyword and explicit types.  Lambda functions are functions that aren't declared but passed immediately as an expression.

### Syntax

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val firstLambda = { println("This is a lambda expression!") }
  firstLambda()
}
```
