# Getting Started

Kotlin is a programming language developed by the creators of IntelliJ and Android Studio.  It allows you to write concise, utilitarian code that avoids all of the unnecessary steps that Java forces you to take.  You can write Kotlin applications from any Java IDE or even the command line!  Here's how you can get started to write some basic programs.

## Installing Onto Your Computer

To set up your computer, check out the Kotlin language's [official tutorial] (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html).  It contains thorough details on setting up a programming environment with IntelliJ IDEA, the command line, and other methods.

## Online Environments

You can also use [Repl.it] (https://repl.it/languages/kotlin), which provides an online development environment that reduces the hassle of setting up an IDE on your computer.  Similarly, [Kotlin Playground] (play.kotlinlang.org) allows you to directly explore and practice the Kotlin language with a simplistic programming environment for beginners.
