# Getting Started

Kotlin is a programming language developed by the creators of IntelliJ and Android Studio.  You can write Kotlin applications from any Java IDE (both online and local) or even from the command line!  For those who want to avoid downloading and locally installing a Kotlin workspace on the computer, it's highly suggested that you use the online IDE's listed below.  For long-term use, however, installing an IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA) directly on your computer will be more efficient.  Here's how you can get started with the setup process.

## Online Environments

You can also use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/kotlin), which provides an online development environment that reduces the hassle of setting up an IDE on your computer.  Similarly, [Kotlin Playground](play.kotlinlang.org) allows you to directly explore and practice the Kotlin language with a simplistic programming environment for beginners.

Note:  the online IDEs are fully-equipped as Kotlin environments and can be used as a practice space for all of the tutorials found on this website.

## Installing Onto Your Computer

To set up your computer, check out the Kotlin language's [official tutorial](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html).  It contains thorough details on setting up a programming environment with IntelliJ IDEA, the command line, and other methods.
