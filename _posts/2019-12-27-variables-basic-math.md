# Variables

A variable is a tool we use when coding to store data or information.  Such information can be of numerous types, like numbers, text, or true/false indicators.  Let's look at the following example:

```kotlin
var a: Int = 1
var b = 6 
var c = 3.14
var d = "hey there"
```

the first line declares a variable named 'a'.  Its type is declared as an Int, or integer, meaning that it can be any positive or negative whole number, and its value is an integer value of 1.  As you can, variables have a type, name, and value.




# Values

In your science classes you learned that variables can change or have multiple values.  In Kotlin, variables can be reset to store something else.  Kotlin also has **values**, which are read-only:  they can't be changed after initialization!
