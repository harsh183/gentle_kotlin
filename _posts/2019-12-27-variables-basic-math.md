# Variables

A variable is a tool we use when coding to store data or information.  Such information can be of numerous types, like numbers, text, or true/false indicators.  Let's look at the following example:

```
var a: Int = 1
var b = 6 
var c = 3.14
var d = "hey there"
```



# Values

In your science classes you learned that variables can change or have multiple values.  In Kotlin, variables can be reset to store something else.  Kotlin also has **values**, which are read-only:  they can't be changed after initialization!
