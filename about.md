Gentle Kotlin is a gentle and wholesome introduction to Kotlin made by people who really like geeking out about the language.

Many of the efforts from here also led to UIUC's [CS199: IKP - Joyful Kotlin](https://kotlin.cs.illinois.edu) which has it's own lessons, runnable code examples, lecture recordings on youtube. It is also the home to the [jeed playground](https://kotlin.cs.illinois.edu/play/) which is one of the fastest Kotlin playgrounds.[Github](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/jeed).
